# Calculator app

A simple calculator application to provide practice/review in:

- basic functionality
- basic styling

Special thank you to Code with Yousaf for the tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6lVvsUkdjI

# thoughts
this was a good practice, it was quick and simple, but now i'm wondering the following:

- is there a way to do this that uses less lines of code? / is there a simpler way to do this?
- this tutorial is from 2023 - are there new methods to do this?
- what should I use instead of eval?

# follow-up
- Host the app somewhere
- add a feature where it displays past calculations until you refresh?
