# thoughts 
this was a good practice, it was quick and simple, but now i'm wondering the following: 
- is there a way to do this that uses less lines of code? / is there a simpler way to do this? 
- this tutorial is from 2023 - are there new methods to do this? 
- what should I use instead of eval? 

# follow-up 
- Host the app on github 
- add a feature where it displays past calculations until you refresh?
